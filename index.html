    This is my portfolio site. As of (3/14/2020) my portfolio site
    was made using a template. This project will be a site done from scratch instead
    of a template. I will be using this site to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I live in the Greater Philadelphia Area and have been here all my life. I attended Lindenwold High School from 2014-2018 and began taking courses at my Community College in 2016, however my Computer Science coursework began in 2018. I obtained
                my Associates in Computer Science in Spring 2020 and am currently continuing my education at Rutgers Camden pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>My Programming Languages class was my first exposure to Python. I'm actively learning more about Python and currently do a lot of my LeetCode problems in Python. However I have no major projects so far in this language.</p>

            <div class="technology">
                <img src="img/technologies/Java_logo.svg">
                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>The first two years of my Computer Science degree constisted of mostly Java, thus most of my coding experience as of right now is in Java. My Data Structures and Algorithims class was taught in this language and I have many school projects
                    written in it such as a discrete event-driven simulation of a hospital emergency room.</p>

                <img src="img/technologies/HTML5_logo.svg">
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>So far, I have made two portfolio sites: One from a template and one from scratch which is the one you are currently seeing. My HTML learning experience began with the former and it served as an introduction to front end developement.</p>

                <img src="img/technologies/CSS3_logo.svg">
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>This portfolio site serves as my first dive into CSS. I'm learning more and more on how to make things look pretty and look forward to styling webpages I'm proud of.</p>
